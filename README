This is a quick simple program to validate sudoku solutions using either multiple threads or proccess written in c.

It takes in a a 9x9 grid of integers seperated by spaces
See the sample solution for an example.

To compile this program you can run the command
gcc -pthread -o output mssv.c
#Only tested on my personal environment
Then you can run the program using 
./output sudoku maxwait
Where maxwait is an integer and sudoku is the name of your sudoku solution.
The program will not run if you do not provide both arguments.
